    <h1 style="color: aqua;">COMPUTER ARCHTECTURE</h1>
    
    <p>Computer archtecture: Is the design / structure of the computer .</p>
    <p>Computer memory: Is the component of the computer that stores data and instructon of the processing .</p>
    <p>Computer memory it's devided into two types which are <br>
    i:: Ram <br>
   ii:: Rom <br>
  iii:: Storage</p>
  <h2>starting with ram:: this is the type of a computer memory that stores data for quicly accessed by the processor . <br>
This it's devided also into two types which are :: <br>
a:: DRAM : Dynamic ram this is the type of ram that it's needed to be refreshed thousands per second . <br>
b:: SRAM  : Static ram this is the type of ram that doesnt to be refreshed as often , this make it faster and more expensive .</h2>

<h3>ROM : this is the non-volatile memory that is used to store firmware and software that is rarely changed .</h3>
<p>This also devided into different types which are <br>
a:: MROM :Re-progamable once by the manufacture not modified .<br>
b:: PROM :Progamable once by user .<br>
c:: EPROM :Can be erased by using UV lights .<br>
d:: EEPROM :This can be erased programmable maltiple by using signals .<br>
